                            <p>As a large, well-established company, we’re proud to offer exceptional job stability and benefits
                                to help our employees stay healthy, balance work and their personal lives and meet their
                                long-term financial goals. In addition to steady hours and competitive pay, our drivers also
                                get:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li class="item">Generous medical, dental & vision coverage</li>
                                <li class="item">401(k) retirement savings with employer matching and immediate vesting</li>
                                <li class="item">Tuition reimbursement</li>

                            <p>Many of our drivers have been with us for as long as 10 to 30 years. And why not? We offer a
                                positive work environment with a family feel, as well as state-of-the-art equipment and vehicles
                                (complete with AC) and opportunities to grow within the company. Unlike many other organizations,
                                we don’t require drivers to do any merchandizing work, and they get to enjoy most nights
                                at home, not on the road. </p>
