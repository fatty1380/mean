                    of this notice and authorization is not limited to the present and, if hired or engaged to transact
                    business with the Company, will continue and allow the Company to conduct future screenings for
                    retention, promotion, reassignment access to the Company’s premises or for a continuing relationship
                    with the Company, unless revoked by me in writing. The Company also reserves the right to share the
