     * Suspended - No longer being worked by 3rd party data provider. Likely due to needing more information.
     * Validated - report data has passed validation and ready to send to 3rd party data provider
     * Queued - client application has successfully sent the report request, but is queued for processing by the report engine.
     * Failed - an error occurred during processing, but is not recoverable so is at end state
     * Need info - data vendor requires more information for processing report
     * Completed - data vendor indicated that the report is finished
     * Rejected - data for applicant info did not pass validation against report field schema (i.e. missing required fields)
