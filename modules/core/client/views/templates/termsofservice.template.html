    otherwise provided in any Additional Terms from Outset regarding Services, the third party service provider is the
    employer of the Driver.</P>

    Further, we do not have control over the quality, timing, or legality of the services actually delivered by Drivers,
    nor of the integrity, responsibility or actions of Job Providers or Drivers. We do not refer or recommend either Job
    Providers or Drivers nor do we make any representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, and accuracy

    guarantee, nor do we represent or warrant as to, the accuracy of such information.</P> <H2

                Can Order or Authorize Background Checks about Themselves and Can Authorize the Sharing of Them with
                Other Members</H2>

<P>
    Outset offers the following background check services from consumer reporting agencies: Background checks and Motor
    Vehicle Reports (collectively &quot;Background Check(s)&quot;). Background Checks must be ordered by Drivers about
    themselves either on their own initiative to increase their chances of employment by Job Providers or in response to
    a request by a Job Provider who is considering hiring them. Background Check services require payment of a separate
    fee by the Member who is initiating the background check request.</P>
<P>
    You understand and agree
    that Outset is not a consumer reporting agency as such term is defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C.
    Section 1681 (the &quot;FCRA&quot;). Unless Outset is reviewing the Background Check report for its own purposes,
    Outset is merely operating as a conduit of the Background Check for the benefit of the Driver or the Job Provider
    and is storing or forwarding the Background Check at their request.</P>
<P>
    The Background Check
    services are regulated by the FCRA, and the background reports resulting from these services are considered &quot;consumer
    reports&quot; under the FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation,
    personal characteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history,
    workers' compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and educational data and reports.</P>
<P>
    You may authorize Outset to receive a copy of the Background Check you ordered and authorized through Outset. See
    Section 4.3 below for information regarding Outset's use of these Background Checks. If you order a Background Check
    about yourself, you will be emailed a copy of the results. It is your decision and responsibility to authorize
    Outset to forward the Background Check to the prospective Job Provider, if you wish to do so. You are also
    responsible for making sure that the email addresses you provide to Outset is correct, knowing that sensitive
    information will be sent to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western"
        >
    If you order Background Check in response to a request by a Job Provider who is considering hiring you we will
    forward the report to you. It is your decision and responsibility to authorize Outset to forward the Background
    Check to the prospective Job Provider, if you wish to do so. In accordance with your authorization at the time you
    ordered the Background Check. The results of any Background Check you order that results in Outset suspending or
    terminating your account will not be shared with other users.</P>
<P>
    If you have ordered a
    Background Check through Outset, we may indicate in your profile that you have completed that check. However, we
    will not share the results with any other site visitor or Registered User without your specific consent.</P>
<H2>4.2. Job Providers- Specific Terms of Use and Special Responsibilities of Job Providers
    under FCRA</H2>
<P>
    Job Providers may request and receive a copy of a Background Check on a Driver, subject to the Driver's explicit
    instructions about who may have access to such a report.</P>
<P CLASS="western"
        ><BR>
</P>
<P> If you receive a copy of a
    background report, you warrant that you will use such information only for a purpose permitted by FCRA, such as an
    employment purpose, and that you will comply with any and all applicable obligations of the FCRA as well as all
    other applicable consumer reporting laws.</P>
<P> Your responsibilities in using the
    information contained the background check can be found at <A
            HREF="http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm"><U>http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm</U>.</A>
    The FCRA governs the use of reports obtained from a consumer reporting agency.</P>
<P>
    If there is negative data
    in a Background Check you receive, and you choose to take &quot;adverse action&quot; (i.e. choose to not hire that
    individual due to information in the Background Check), the FCRA requires you to take certain procedural steps,
    which can be found at <A HREF="http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm"><U>http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm</U>.</A>
    These include but are not necessarily limited to: providing pre-adverse notice to the individual who is subject to
    the Background Check report (Driver), suspend the hiring process for a period of time for the Driver to dispute the
    information with the consumer reporting agency and notifying the Driver who is the subject of the report of your
    decision to take adverse action based on information contained in the Background Check report. We recommend working
    with an attorney to ensure you comply with your requirements under the FCRA.</P>
<H2> 4.3 Outset May Review
    and Use Background Checks You Order or Authorize About Yourself</H2> <H3
        >
    By using the Site or Services as a Driver, you acknowledge and agree Outset may review and use any Background Checks
    you have ordered or authorized about yourself for the legitimate business purpose of protecting the safety and
    integrity of our Site and its users and reserves the right to terminate your membership based on the information
    contained in such report, even if such information was subsequently dismissed.</H3>
<P>
    If Outset terminates your
    membership or access to the Site on the basis of information in a Background Check, we will notify you and provide
    you the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide
    you a copy of the report. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Outset does not have control
    over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these
    Background Checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must be addressed with the consumer reporting agency
    that issued it and not Outset.</P>

            for Results of Background Checks, Verification Checks, and Motor Vehicle Reports</B></P>
    </OL>
</OL>
<P>
    As a Job Provider, if you decide to use or access information included in a MVR and/or a Background Check, you
    hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that those checks are not always accurate or complete (or based on
    information that is accurate or complete) and that the specific records searched, and the comprehensiveness of the
    search, varies by the type of Background Check ordered as well as the state and county where the check is performed.
    For example, many jurisdictions only include felony conviction records (and not, for example, misdemeanor or arrest
    records) in the national criminal database, which is the only data source utilized for preliminary background checks
    other than the sexual offender registry. Moreover, some states include only registered sex offenders in that
    database.</P>
<P>
    If you decide to access, use, or share information provided by a Background Check, you agree to do so in accordance
    with applicable law. You also agree to indemnify and hold harmless Outset from any loss, liability, damage, or costs
    that may result from such access, use, or sharing of this information regardless of the cause. Outset does not
    assume and expressly disclaims, and you hereby agree to release Outset from, any loss, liability, damage, or costs
    that may result from the use of information provided in a background report including, without limitation, the
    inaccuracy or incompleteness of any such information.</P>
<P> If you decide to use or access
    information included in a MVR you hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that those checks are not always
    accurate or complete (or based on information that is accurate or complete) and that the specific records searched,
    and the comprehensiveness of the search, varies by the state or other jurisdiction that the MVR report was performed
    (for example, each state may have its own MVR database and the MVR report you use or access may only be for a single
    state, and not accurately reporting MVR records from another state).</P>
<P>
    You expressly acknowledge
    that Outset has no obligation to perform MVR, Background Checks, or Verification Checks on any Registered Users. A
    User’s status as a Registered User on <A HREF="http://www.joinoutset.com/">www.joinoutset.com </A>should
    not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive evidence of the accuracy of any information those users

    sites, or has any association with their operators.</P>
<P> Users
    further acknowledge that use of any site controlled, owned or operated by third parties is governed by the terms and
    conditions of use for those sites, and not by Outset's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Outset expressly disclaims

<H1>Payment And Refund Policy</H1>
<P>
    In order to utilize some Outset Services or product offerings, the user of such Services or product offerings must
    pay Outset either a recurring subscription or one-time fee. In addition, the user is responsible for any state or
    local sales taxes associated with the Services or product offerings purchased.</P>
<H2>8.1 Billing and Payment</H2>
<P> If you sign up
    for an Outset paid membership subscription, you agree to pay Outset all subscription charges associated with the
    plan you subscribe to as described on the Site at the time you subscribe and provide your payment information. You
    also authorize Outset to charge your chosen payment provider according to the terms of the plan to which you
    subscribe. The subscription period and the amount and frequency of the charges will vary depending on the
    subscription plan you select. Outset reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it
    has already requested or received payment.</P>
<P> To the extent you elect to purchase
    other Services or product offerings we may offer for a fee, you authorize Outset to charge your chosen payment
    provider for the Services and/or products you purchase. You agree that if Outset already has your credit card on
    file as a result of prior purchases you have made, we may charge that credit card for the additional
    Services/products you purchase.</P>
<H2>8.2 Automatic Subscription Renewal and Cancellation</H2>
<P>
    Outset paid membership subscriptions will continue indefinitely until cancelled by the user. After your initial
    subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will
    automatically renew for an additional equivalent period as the subscription term you originally selected and at the
    subscription rate and frequency disclosed to you on the Site when you originally subscribed, unless otherwise
    provided at the time you subscribed. If you sign up for a payment plan that allows you to be charged monthly over
    the subscription period and you decide to cancel your subscription during the subscription period, you acknowledge
    and agree that you will continue to be billed for the subscription on a monthly basis until its originally scheduled
    expiration date.</P>
<P CLASS="western"

        >
    You may cancel your paid membership subscription by adjusting your <U>account settings</U>. If you
    cancel your subscription, you typically will be permitted to use your subscription until the end of your
    then-current subscription term. Your subscription will not be renewed after your then- current term expires, but
    your credit card will be charged, and you will be required to pay, any cancellation or other fees associated with
    your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up for the subscription plan.</P>

    the foregoing, if you have a paid membership subscription that is automatically renewed, we will refund the most
    recent charge to your credit card if (i) you cancel your subscription within thirty (30) days after the most recent
    charge, and </P>
<P> (ii) you have not
    used your subscription during the current renewal period. The refund will apply to the most recent charge only. In
    addition, Outset reserves the right to immediately downgrade or cancel your membership after payment of your refund.
    Outset does not provide refunds or credits under any other circumstances, unless it determines in its sole
    discretion that a refund or credit is warranted due to extenuating circumstances, such as a duplicate account.</P>
<P></P>
<H2>8.4 Free Trial Offers</H2>
<P>
    Outset may offer limited-time free trial subscriptions to certain users from time-to-time. Users who sign up for an
    Outset Service on a free trial basis may have limited access to the Service and/or features of the Site. If a user
    signs up for a free trial subscription, after the expiration of the free trial period, the user will be charged the
    price then in effect for a subscription to the Service, unless otherwise provided to him or her when he or she
    originally subscribed. If a user does not want to continue with the Service after the expiration of the free trial
    period, the Job Provider or Driver must cancel their subscription within thirty (30) days of being charged the
    subscription fee for the Service. Upon cancellation, the Driver or Employment Provider’s credit card will be
    refunded for the amount of the most recent subscription charge so long as he or she has not used the subscription
    after the expiration of the free trial period.</P>

<P>
    Outset is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. So before you commence arbitration, we
    suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint, as we may be able to resolve it without the need for
    arbitration. You may contact us via email at <A HREF="mailto:support@joinoutset.com">support@joinoutset.com</A> or
    at Outset Partners, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, The Vault,415 Jackson St. Suite B, San Francisco, CA 94111.</P>
<H2>13.4 Arbitration Procedures</H2>
<P>
    Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's (&quot;AAA&quot;)
    rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the
    &quot;AAA Rules&quot;), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its
    website, <A HREF="http://www.adr.org/"><U>http://www.adr.org</U>.</A> Information about the AAA's Rules and fees for
    consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, <A
        HREF="http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration"><U>http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration</U>.</A> If there is
    any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will
    control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would
    not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a
    court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 11. Although
    arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the
    arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual
    under the Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a
    court only for very limited reasons.</P>
<P> To commence an arbitration
    against Outset, you must complete a short form, submit it to the AAA, and send a copy to Outset at Outset Partners,
    Inc., Attn: Legal Department, The Vault, 415 Jackson St. Suite B San Francisco, CA 94111. For more information, see
    the AAA's claim filing page, <A HREF="http://www.adr.org/fileacase"><U>http://www.adr.org/fileacase</U>.</A> You may
    represent yourself in the arbitration or be represented by an attorney or another representative. Once we receive
    your arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims we may have against you.</P>
<P>
    The arbitration shall be
    held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is
    $10,000 or less you or Outset may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written
    submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Outset subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an
    in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you
    and/or Outset, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</P>
<P> The arbitrator will decide the
    substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including recognized principles of
    equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in
    prior arbitrations involving different Outset users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the
    same Outset user to the extent required by applicable law.</P>
<H2>13.5 Costs of Arbitration</H2>
<P>
    Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the &quot;Arbitration Fees&quot;) will be
    governed by the AAA's Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you demonstrate to the
    arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator
    otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees,
    Outset will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of
    arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Outset will pay as much of the Arbitration
    Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Each party will be
    responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all
    attorney fees. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the</P>
<P CLASS="western"

        >
    arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Outset for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by
    Outset on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</P>
<H2>13.6 Confidentiality</H2>
<P>
    All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly
    confidential for the benefit of all parties.</P>
<H2>13.7 Severability</H2>
<P>If a court
    decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than Section</P>
<P CLASS="western"

        >
    13.2 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that
    is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
    provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that any of the
    provisions of Section 13.2 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be
    null and void. The remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.</P>
<H2>13.8 Opt-Out Procedure</H2>
<P>
    You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice (&quot;Opt-Out Notice&quot;)
    in accordance with the terms of this Section. For new Outset users, the Opt- Out Notice must be postmarked no later
    than 30 Days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time or January 5, 2015, whichever is later. 3. You
    must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Outset Partners, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 415 Jackson St Suite B, San
    Francisco, CA 94111. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and must
    include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the Outset account(s) to which
    the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can
    opt out of the Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, all other terms of these Terms
    will continue to apply. Opting out of the Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future
    arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</P>
<H2>13.9 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</H2>
<P>
    Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this
    Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future,
    that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Outset prior to the effective
    date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Arbitration Agreement from these Terms, such termination
    shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is
    posted to the Site, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Outset
    prior to the effective date of removal.</P>
<H1>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</H1>
<P>
    These Terms, and any dispute between you and Outset, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without
    regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation
    and enforcement of Section 13, the Arbitration Agreement. Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the
    Arbitration Agreement 13 is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute (except for small-claims
    court actions), either as a result of your decision to opt- out of the Arbitration Agreement or as a result of a
    decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise
    between you and Outset must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Delaware. .
    You and Outset agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Delaware for
    the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</P>

    Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as making either party the partner, joint venture, agent, legal
    representative, employer, contractor or employee of the other. Neither party shall have, or hold itself out to any
    third party as having any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take
    any action, that shall be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party
    to be bound. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms shall in no way
    effect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. In the event a term
    or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with
    a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
    or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms shall be enforceable as so modified. Each Affiliate (as defined
    in Section 1.2) is expressly made a third party beneficiary of this Agreement and may enforce this Agreement
    directly against you. This Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal representatives,
    successors and assigns of the parties hereto.</P>
